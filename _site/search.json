    "text": "4.1 Demographic Analysis\n\n4.1.1 Observation on working population\nDistribution of Income\nWe will first take a look at the Income Distribution using histogram and boxplot.\nBased on the boxplot plotted, we can observe that the minimum income is $1600, which means that all the participants are part of the working population and we can analyse them as a whole.\nFurthermore, we can observe that the shape of the wage distribution shows that there is an income inequality in the city. It has a right-skewed distribution, i.e. mean wage > median wage, where there is a very small elite at the top, with most people nearer to the middle and bottom.\n\n\nShow the code\n#computing summary statistics of mean, median and lower and upper whiskers in boxplot\nwage_mean <- round(mean(combined_table$Wage))\nwage_median <- round(median(combined_table$Wage))\nymax <- as.numeric(round((IQR(combined_table$Wage)*1.5) +\n                quantile(combined_table$Wage,0.75)))\nymin <- as.integer(min(combined_table$Wage))\n\n#plotting histogram\nh_wage <- ggplot(data = combined_table, aes(x = Wage)) + \n  geom_histogram(color=\"black\", fill=\"azure4\", binwidth = 500) + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,25000), labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(x = \"Wage\", y = \"Number of participants\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = wage_mean), col=\"darkblue\", linewidth=0.75) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=5900, y=1700, label=\"Mean wage:\", \n           size=3, color=\"darkblue\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=5600, y=1550, label=format(wage_mean, big.mark = \",\"),\n           size=3, color=\"darkblue\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = wage_median), col=\"lightpink4\", linewidth=0.75) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=1900, y=1700, label=\"Median wage\", \n           size=3, color=\"lightpink4\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=1900, y=1600, label=format(wage_median, big.mark = \",\"),\n           size=3, color=\"lightpink4\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=8))\n\n#plotting boxplot\nb_wage <- ggplot(data = combined_table, aes(y = Wage)) + \n  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour=\"firebrick\", outlier.shape=16,\n               outlier.size=0.6, notch=FALSE, width = 0.25) + \n  coord_flip() + labs(y = \"\", x = \"\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,25000), labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) + \n  stat_boxplot(geom=\"errorbar\", width=0.25) + \n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.20, y=ymax, label=format(ymax, big.mark = \",\"), \n           size=3, color=\"lightpink4\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.20, y=ymin, label=format(ymin, big.mark = \",\"), \n           size=3, color=\"lightpink4\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=-0.25, y=5000, label=format(wage_median, big.mark = \",\"),\n           size=3, color=\"lightpink4\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=-0.25, y=2500, label=\"Median wage =\",\n           size=3, color=\"lightpink4\")\n\n# combine the 2 plots \n\nwage_distri <- b_wage / h_wage + plot_layout(heights = c(1, 2)) \n\nwage_distri + plot_annotation(title = \"Distribution of Wage\", \n                               subtitle = str_wrap(\"There is a right-skewed distribution i.e. mean wage > median wage.

The results of the Shaprio-test above also suggest that there is sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis at 95% confidence. Thus, the set of data is indeed not normally distributed, showing that the city has income inequality.\nDistribution of Age\nThe boxplot shows that the minimum age is 18 and the maximum age is 60, which is most likely the retirement age. The histogram shows that the age is normally distributed,where the mean age equals the median age of 39. Thus, it appears that the city of engagement does not need to worry about aging population, which in turn meant that they do not need to invest in improving birth rate.\nHowever, based on the pie chart, we can see that though the starting age is 18, only 5% of the working population is below the age of 21. This is probably because most are still studying at this age.\n\n\nShow the code\nage_count <- combined_table %>%\n  group_by(age_bin) %>%\n  summarize(\n    count = n_distinct(participantId)) %>% \n  mutate(prop_count = as.numeric(count) / n_distinct(as.numeric(combined_table$participantId)),\n         age_pie_pct = round(prop_count * 100)) %>% \n  mutate(ypos_p = rev(cumsum(rev(age_pie_pct))),\n         pos_p = age_pie_pct/2 + lead(ypos_p, 1, default = 0),\n         pos_p = if_else(is.na(pos_p), age_pie_pct/2, pos_p))\n\npie_age <- ggplot(age_count, aes(x = \"\" , y = age_pie_pct, fill = fct_inorder(age_bin))) +\n  geom_col(width = 1, color = 1) +\n  coord_polar(theta = \"y\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGnBu\") +\n  geom_label_repel(data = age_count,\n                   aes(y = pos_p, label = paste0(age_pie_pct, \"%\")),\n                   size = 4.5, nudge_x = 1, color = c(1, 1, 1, 1, 1), show.legend = FALSE) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = \"Age Bin\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Proportion of participants in each Age Bin\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\",\n        plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\")) +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#computing summary statistics of mean, median and lower and upper whiskers in boxplot for AGE\nage_mean <- round(mean(combined_table$age))\nage_median <- round(median(combined_table$age))\nymax <- max(combined_table$age)\nymin <- as.integer(min(combined_table$age))\n\n#plotting histogram for AGE\nh_age <- ggplot(data = combined_table, aes(x = age)) + \n  geom_histogram(color=\"black\", fill=\"azure4\", binwidth = 4) + \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0,70), labels = scales::comma) +\n  labs(x = \"Age\", y = \"Number of participants\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = age_mean), col=\"black\", linewidth=0.75) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=48, y=1700, label=\"Mean age:\", \n           size=3, color=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=48, y=1600, label=format(age_mean, big.mark = \",\"),\n           size=3, color=\"black\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = age_median), col=\"black\", linewidth=0.75) +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=30, y=1750, label=\"Median age:\", \n           size=3, color=\"black\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=30, y=1650, label=format(age_median, big.mark = \",\"),\n           size=3, color=\"black\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=8))\n\n#plotting boxplot for AGE\nb_age <- ggplot(data = combined_table, aes(y = age)) + \n  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour=\"firebrick\", outlier.shape=16,\n               outlier.size=1, notch=FALSE, width =0.2) + \n  coord_flip() + labs(y = \"\", x = \"\") + \n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,70), labels = scales::comma) +\n  theme(axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) + \n  stat_boxplot(geom=\"errorbar\", width=0.2) + \n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.15, y=ymax, label=format(ymax, big.mark = \",\"), \n           size=3, color=\"lightpink4\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=0.15, y=ymin, label=format(ymin, big.mark = \",\"), \n           size=3, color=\"lightpink4\") \n  #annotate(\"text\", x=-0.25, y=50, label=format(age_median, big.mark = \",\"),\n           #size=3, color=\"lightpink4\") \n  #annotate(\"text\", x=-0.25, y=25, label=\"Median age =\",\n           #size=3, color=\"lightpink4\")\n\nage_distri <- b_age / h_age + plot_layout(heights = c(1, 2)) \n\n# age_distri + plot_annotation(title = \"Distribution of Age\", \n#                                subtitle = \"There is a normal distribution i.e. mean age = median age\",\n#                                theme = theme(\n#                                  plot.title = element_text(size = 18),\n#                                  plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12)))\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#combine the age_distri plot dervied earlier with the pie_age plot\nage_distri_pie <- (age_distri | pie_age) + plot_layout(widths = c(3,3))\n\nage_distri_pie + plot_annotation(title = \"Distribution of Age\", \n                               theme = theme(\n                                 plot.title = element_text(size = 16)))"

When you are older, you are likely to earn more.\nTo compare the income level across ages, we will test the following null hypothesis:\nH0: the mean wage across different age groups are the same H1: the mean wage across different age groups are different\nTo start the confirmatory data analysis, we first perform the normality assumption test for the distribution of income and age.

This suggests that the differences between the medians of the pair are not statistically significant.\nWe can also observe that there is a higher wage median for those age 30-40. After the age of 40, it seems that the increase in age is not consistent with the increase in wage. The 2 highest wage level are from the opposite ends of the age spectrum. Though these are outliers, it suggests that age is not the limiting factor for high wage tier. It does not necessary mean that an individual has to be older to earn a higher income."

Based on the plot below, we can see that the mean of the financial health is at the highest in March 2022 at around $4800 and decreased significantly in April 2022.

Recreation expenses, on the hand, is high in March and decreases significantly from March 2022 to April 2022 and plateaus to a stable rate thereafter.\nLooking at the wage over time plot, we can see that in March, the mean income is at its peak in March 2022 and dips significantly in April 2022. April 2022 onwards, the income remains relatively stable and starts to increase slightly in August 2022, but in Han 2023 it start to decrease further. The fluctuations in the financial health and income is directly proportionate. And we can also see that, recreation expenses increases when there is an increase in income but remain low when income is low.\nSince this is an agricultural city, participants’ pay could be likely to be affected by the seasons and harvest.\n\n# expenses_grouped <- combined_table %>%\n#   group_by(month_year) %>%\n#   summarize(total_recreation = mean(Recreation),\n#             total_food = mean(Food),\n#             total_shelter = mean(Shelter),\n#             total_education = mean(Education)) %>% \n#   pivot_longer(cols = c(total_recreation, total_food, total_shelter, total_education), names_to = \"expense_type\", values_to = \"expense\")\n# head(expenses_grouped)\n\n#CHECK WHY CANT PLOT\n\n # ggplot(data = expenses_grouped, aes(x = expense, y = expense_type, fill = after_stat(x))) +\n #   \n #   geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n #  \n #   theme_minimal() +\n #  \n #     labs(title = 'Expenses by Category Over Time: {frame_time}',\n #        y = \"Type of Expense\",\n #        x = \"Total Expense\") +\n #   \n #   theme(legend.position=\"none\",\n #   text = element_text(family = \"Garamond\"),\n #   plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 12),\n #   \n #   axis.title.x = element_text(size = 10, hjust = 1),\n #   axis.title.y = element_text(size = 10),\n #   axis.text = element_text(size = 8)) +\n #   \n #   scale_fill_viridis(name = \"expense\", option = \"D\") +\n # \n #   transition_time(\"month_year\") +\n #   ease_aes('linear')\n\nWage vs Cost of Living overtime\n\n# Creating a table with Wage and Cost of Living by month_year\n\n# Group the data by month and find the corresponding means\ndf_monthly <- combined_table %>%\n  group_by(month_year) %>%\n  summarise(mean_income = mean(Wage),\n            mean_cost_of_living = mean(Cost_of_living))\n# Melt the data frame to create a long format\ndf_monthly_melt <- melt(df_monthly, id.vars = \"month_year\", variable.name = \"variable\", value.name = \"value\")\n\n#CHECK FOR THE XAXIS SCALE\n\n\nShow the code\n# Plot using ggplot2\nggplot(df_monthly_melt, aes(x = month_year, y = value, fill = variable)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge(width = 25), alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_manual(name = \"Legend\", values = c(\"mean_income\" = \"blue\", \"mean_cost_of_living\" = \"red\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Month\", y = \"Mean\", title = \"Monthly Mean Income and Cost of Living\") +\n  scale_x_date(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45))\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(hjust = 0.4, vjust = 0.5, size = 5)) \n\n\nList of 1\n $ axis.text.x:List of 11\n  ..$ family       : NULL\n  ..$ face         : NULL\n  ..$ colour       : NULL\n  ..$ size         : num 5\n  ..$ hjust        : num 0.4\n  ..$ vjust        : num 0.5\n  ..$ angle        : NULL\n  ..$ lineheight   : NULL\n  ..$ margin       : NULL\n  ..$ debug        : NULL\n  ..$ inherit.blank: logi FALSE\n  ..- attr(*, \"class\")= chr [1:2] \"element_text\" \"element\"\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr [1:2] \"theme\" \"gg\"\n - attr(*, \"complete\")= logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"validate\")= logi TRUE\n\n\nLooking at the wage vs cost of living, we can see that on average, most citizens can cope with their cost of living as their mean wage (blue bars) is higher than the mean cost of living (red bars). Most citizens should still have savings monthly."

This could be due to the presence of large no of outliers, and probably at the stage of the deciding their career path. On the other hand, age_bin such as [18,20) has less uncertainties,which may indicate lower presence of outliers.\nLikewise, for the educationLevel plot below, low level education has less uncertainties, while the higher educationLevel, the higher the uncertainties get.\n\nAge_bineducationLevel\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#Base ggplot\nggplot(\n  data = combined_table,\n  aes(x = age_bin,\n      y = Wage)) +\n  \n#Using stat_pointinterval to plot the points and intervals\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    aes(interval_color = stat(level)),\n    .width = c(0.95, 0.99),\n    .point = median,\n    .interval = qi,\n    point_color = \"darkred\",\n    show.legend = FALSE) +\n\n#Defining the color of the intervals \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"blue2\", \"darkblue\"),\n    aesthetics = \"interval_color\") +\n  \n#Title, subtitle, and caption\n  labs(title = 'Visualising uncertainty in median estimates of wage by age_bin',\n  subtitle = 'Quantiles intervals (95% and 99%) of wage by age_bin',\n  x = \"age_bin\",\n  y = \"Wage\") +\n  \n  theme_hc() +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow the code\n#Base ggplot\nggplot(\n  data = combined_table,\n  aes(x = educationLevel,\n      y = Wage)) +\n  \n#Using stat_pointinterval to plot the points and intervals\n  stat_pointinterval(\n    aes(interval_color = stat(level)),\n    .width = c(0.95, 0.99),\n    .point = median,\n    .interval = qi,\n    point_color = \"darkred\",\n    show.legend = FALSE) +\n\n#Defining the color of the intervals \n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"blue2\", \"darkblue\"),\n    aesthetics = \"interval_color\") +\n  \n#Title, subtitle, and caption\n  labs(title = 'Visualising uncertainty in median estimates of wage by educationLevel',\n  subtitle = 'Quantiles intervals (95% and 99%) of wage by educationLevel',\n  x = \"educationLevel\",\n  y = \"Wage\") +\n  \n  theme_hc() +\n  \n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n        plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 14),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1))"
