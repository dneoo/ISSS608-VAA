<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="distribution-of-income"><strong>Distribution of Income</strong></h4>
<p>We will first take a look at the Income Distribution using <code>histogram and boxplot</code>.</p>
<p>Based on the boxplot plotted, we can observe that the minimum income is $1600, which means that all the participants are considering under the working population and we can analyse them as a whole.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can observe from the shape of the wage distribution that there is income inequality in the city. It has a right-skewed distribution, i.e.&nbsp;mean wage &gt; median wage, where there is very few high earners at the top and majority falls under the middle and bottom.</p>

<p>To confirm that the wage distribution is indeed not normally distributed, we will perform the normality assumption test. But before performing the normality assumption test, we will first create the meanwage_table as shown in the code chunk below,</p>

<p>Looking at Normal Quartile Plot (Q-Q plot), we can see that the points deviate significantly from the straight diagonal line. The results of the Shaprio-test above also suggest that there is sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis at 95% confidence. Thus, the set of data is indeed not normally distributed, showing that the city has income inequality.</p>
</section>
<section id="distribution-of-age" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="distribution-of-age"><strong>Distribution of Age</strong></h4>
<p>Similarly, we will use histogram and boxplot to show the age distribution.</p>
<p>The boxplot below shows that the minimum age is 18 and the maximum age is 60, which is most likely the retirement age. The histogram shows that the age is normally distributed,where the mean age equals the median age of 39. Thus, it appears that the city of engagement does not need to worry about aging population, which in turn meant that they do not need to invest in improving birth rate.</p>
<p>However, based on the pie chart, we can see that though the starting age is 18, only 5% of the working population is below the age of 21. This is probably because most are still studying at thar age and are not actively working.</p>

<p>Let’s find out if income is affected by age.</p>
<p>To compare the income level across ages, we will test the following null hypothesis:</p>
<p><strong><em>H0: the mean wage across different age groups are the same</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>H1: the mean wage across different age groups are different</em></strong></p>
<p>To start the confirmatory data analysis, we first perform the normality assumption test for the distribution of income and age. Normality assumption test for income has been performed previously.</p>
<p>Plot the qqplot for income and age.</p>

<p>Based on the Shapiro test, both the p-value are &lt; alpha value of 0.05, thus there is sufficient statistical evidence to conclude that the distribution of income and age are not normally distributed. Thus we will perform the non-parametric test, <code>Oneway ANOVA Test</code>.</p>

<p>The Kruskal-Wallis Test p-value is lower than the alpha values, thus there is sufficient statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis and infer that the mean income across age is not the same.</p>
<p>We can observe that there are few pairs of age_bin with p-value &gt; 0.05 such as [40,50) and [50,60]. This suggests that the differences between the medians of the pair are not statistically significant.</p>
<p>We can also observe that there is a higher wage median for those age 30-40. After the age of 40, it seems that the increase in age is not consistent with the increase in wage. The 2 highest wage level are from the opposite ends of the age spectrum. Though these are outliers, it suggests that age is not the limiting factor for high wage tier. It does not necessary mean that an individual has to be older to earn a higher income.</p>

<p>To find out if financial health is affected by wage or cost of living, we <code>correlogram</code> to see the correlation between financial health and wage, cost of living and the various expense category. Based on the correlation table and the significant test of correlation, we can see that financial health and wage has a strong positive correlation of 0.98 , while cost of living has low negative correlation of -0.14.</p>
<p>Based on the correlogram below, we can also observe that there Recreation and Shelter has a high correlation with Cost of living.</p>

<p>Looking at the expenses over time plot above, it showed that education, food and shelter remained stable over time, which meant these costs are most likely fixed despite any wage fluations. Recreation expenses, on the hand, is high in March and decreases significantly from March 2022 to April 2022 and plateaus to a stable rate thereafter.</p>
<p>Looking at the wage over time plot, we can see that in March, the mean income is at its peak in March 2022 and dips significantly in April 2022. April 2022 onwards, the income remains relatively stable and starts to increase slightly in August 2022, but in Han 2023 it start to decrease further. The fluctuations in the financial health and income is directly proportionate. And we can also see that, recreation expenses increases when there is an increase in income but remain low when income is low.</p>
<p>Since this is an agricultural city, participants’ pay could be likely to be affected by the seasons and harvest.</p>

<p>Looking at the wage vs cost of living, we can see that on average, most citizens can cope with their cost of living as their mean wage (blue bars) is higher than the mean cost of living (red bars). Most citizens should still have savings monthly.</p>

<p>We observe here that education is positively correlated to wage and financial health of the citizens. The higher the education level, the higher the financial health. Also, we can see that citizen with kids tend to have better financial health overall. Thus, showing that good education is necessary for higher wage.</p>
<p>To further confirm that wage is affected by education level, we will test the following null hypothesis:</p>
<p>H0: the mean wage across different education levels are the same H1: the mean wage across different education levels are different</p>
<p>As based on previous normality assumption test done for wage, we know that wage is not normally distributed. Thus, to test the null hypothesis, we will perform the non-parametric test, <code>Oneway ANOVA Test</code>.</p>

<p>Since the p-value &lt; critical value of 0.05, there is statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis. We can thus conclude that education indeed does affect one’s wage and overall the median wage is higher for higher education level, which is consistent with our findings earlier.</p>

<p>To find out the factors that could possibly affect joviality, we plot the below <code>correlogram</code>. However, looking at the plot below, we can see that none of the factors have correlation more than 0.5. Joviality has a negative correlation relationship with wage, expense, and savings.</p>

<p>Even though correlation between joviality is weak (-0.35), we can observe the smooth red curve is relatively different across different income levels. It appears joviality has a strong correlation for lower income levels as compaeed to the rich. when broken down in health levels, it appears that joviality has the lowest correlation for middle income, the R2= 0.006.</p>
<p>However, we also observed that there are poor people who have the highest joviality of 0.90 whereas for the income earners (in red), all of them have a joviality score below 0.64. Thus, we can conclude that being rich does not necessarily make citizens happy.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="visualizing-uncertainty-of-point-estimates">4.4.1 Visualizing uncertainty of point estimates</h3>
<p>It can be tempting to interpret point estimates like median as the true precise representation of the true data value. However, it should be noted that there are uncertainties surrounding these point estimates. Thus we want to show the target quantile confidence levels (95% or 99%) that the true (unknown) estimate would like within the interval, given evidence provided by observed data.</p>
<p>As can been seen from the age_bin plot below, some age_bin have higher uncertainties such as age_bin [20,30) and [50,60]. This could be due to the presence of large no of outliers, and probably at the stage of the deciding their career path. On the other hand, age_bin such as [18,20) has less uncertainties,which may indicate lower presence of outliers.</p>
<p>Likewise, for the educationLevel plot below, low level education has less uncertainties, while the higher educationLevel, the higher the uncertainties get.</p>
